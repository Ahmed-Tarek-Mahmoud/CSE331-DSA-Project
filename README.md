## Introduction
This project extends the functionality of a normal XML processing tool to provide advanced operations, including validation, correction, data conversion, visualization, and network analysis operations. Also there is a windows version provided to download and use. 

## Features

- **XML Validation**: Detect and fix issues like mismatched or missing tags.
- **Formatting**: Prettify XML with proper indentation for enhacing readability.
- **XML to JSON Conversion**: Transform XML data into JSON file.
- **Minification**: Reduce XML file size by removing unnecessary spaces and newlines.
- **Compression**: Compress XML files into a custom format to save space.
- **Decompression**: Restore compressed XML files to their original format.
- **Visualization**: Visualize social networks as graphs (JPG Image).
- **Network Analysis**: Identify influencers , Active Users, Mutual connections, and friends suggestions.
- **Post Search**: Search posts by a specific word or topic.

### **Command Line Interface (CLI)**
Perform quick and efficient operations on XML files via the CLI using the `.exe` executable provided, `xml_editor`:
```bash
./xml_editor [command] -i [input_file] -o [output_file]
```
> [!NOTE]
> Replace `[command]` with one of the available commands listed [below](#commands-overview).
> Replace `[input_file]` and `[output_file]` with the corresponding file names.
